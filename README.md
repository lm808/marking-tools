# marking-tools
Some simple codes to help marking.

Edit first few lines of `marks_input_*.py` for each question, adding title and marks for each part, then run in python3. Saves to a constantly-updating `.csv` file as you finish marking each script. Use:

- `marks_input.py`    for a command line interface.
- `marks_input_ios.py`   for a GUI in [Pythonista](https://omz-software.com/pythonista/) if you are using a mobile device.
